# Sorry that was a note for my reddragon keyboard that had the arrow keys swapped foor wasd. I hope this helped with creating your own SIEM Home lab. Make sure to log into elastic to configure your integrations to see specific logs.
# The next project will be me using this same homelab to onboard users and simulate a ssh brute force attack against various users and spotting the attack on the logs that will be customized. 

# See you then and thanks for reading!
