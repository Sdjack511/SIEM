# Check your IP address by inputting:
ifconfig
# If that command does not work make sure you install net-tools with
sudo apt install net-tools
# With your IP address lets establish a remote connection with Elastic by navigating to a web browser and going to the addres "IP adress:5601" or I.E

# Once these keys are generated, add each key to respective locations, examples below.

# Add the subsequent key when it asks you to enter the value. Rinse repeat for the other two as shown:
./kibana-keystore add xpack.reporting.encryptionKey - select enter then enter value
./kibana-keystore add xpack.security.encryptionKey - same instruction for the last location
# Restart Kibana
sudo systemctl restart kibana

# You should be taken to the next screen, asking for a verification code. Navigate back to the terminal, and input:
cd /usr/share/kibana/bin

# Add the verification code and it is now configured. Just simply log in.
# Username is: elastic
# Password: Is in the steps below. Sorry to leave you with a cliff hanger, I couldn't resist.

sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
# Input the same value to reset for elastic as well
# New Value: shows your password, copy this and save this password
# You should now be able to log into kibana and elastic remotely. all programs should be properly configured as well.

# Sorry that was a note for my reddragon keyboard that had the arrow keys swapped foor wasd. I hope this helped with creating your own SIEM Home lab. Make sure to log into elastic to configure your integrations to see specific logs.
# The next project will be me using this same homelab to onboard users and simulate a ssh brute force attack against various users and spotting the attack on the logs that will be customized. 

# See you then and thanks for reading!
